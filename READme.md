# Pittsburgh Zoo Animal Tracker

### By Blake Womack

## Description
The local zoo asked me to design a minimum viable product that would allow users (zoo employees and interns) to keep track of animals, enter new animals, filter by animal age, keep track of animal likes and dislikes.

The zoo has an ongoing internship program with the local chapter of AFB (American Foundation for the Blind) and has requested that the application be useable by interns that are blind or sight impaired.

## Basic Requirements
* Add newly admitted animals to the application/DB
* View a list of animals
* Options to view all animals, young animals, or mature animals
* Click on an animal to edit its information

## Local Setup And Installation
* Clone repository [local-zoo]
* Move to the top level of the directory
* Run "npm install"
* Run "bower install"
* Run "gulp build"
* Run "gulp serve"

## Technologies Used
* TypeScript
* Angular2
* Bower
* Gulp
* Sass
